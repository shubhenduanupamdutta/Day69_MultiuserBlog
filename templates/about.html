        <p> My name is Shubhendu Anupam Dutta (शुभेन्दु अनुपम दत्त). I am a Indian national. Currently, I am studying for my Ph.D.
        in Department of Interdisciplinary Centre for Energy Research (ICER), Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am
        working with Prof. Satyam Suwas and Prof. Satish V. Kailas.</p>
        <p> I obtained my B.Tech. (Hons.) and  M. Tech. from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. After passing
        matriculation from Saraswati Vidya Mandir, Gumla and +2 from DPS Ranchi, I took a one year break to prepare for
        IIT entrance exams. I got into IIT with AIR of less than 2500. I was quite proud of that.</p>
        <p> I went through quite a bit of up and down in IIT Kharagpur, My SGPA started from less than 6.0 (out of 10.0)
        and finally I got CGPA of greater than 8.5. In one semester I even got SGPA of 10.0.</p>
        <p> As from this website you can guess, that right now I am quite interested in Python. It started with learning
        python to automate somethings. Then it was about learning a bit seriously because some simulation (like DAMASK)
        were in python. Then I started liking web development via Flask, game development via Turtle, Data Science. I am
        now very close to completing 100 Days of Code, Python Bootcamp course in udemy. And I have learnt many many things
        about python. And I also found out that there are many many things there which I have yet to learn. I will continue
        on the journey of mastering python.</p>
        <p> <h3 style='text-align:center;'> Following will be the certification I have obtained in IT courses.</h3></p>
